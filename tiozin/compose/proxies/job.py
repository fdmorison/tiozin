class JobProxy(wrapt.ObjectProxy):
    """
    Runtime proxy that enriches a Job with Tiozin's core capabilities.

    The JobProxy adds cross-cutting runtime features, such as templating, logging,
    context creation, and lifecycle control, to Tio-defined Job implementations,
    without modifying the original Tiozin plugin.

    The wrapped Job remains unaware of the proxy and is expected to focus exclusively
    on assembling and coordinating its steps, rather than managing runtime concerns.

    Core responsibilities include:
    - Managing the execution lifecycle (setup, execute, teardown)
    - Constructing and providing a Context for the Job execution
    - Initializing template variables and shared session state
    - Enforcing runtime constraints and access policies
    - Providing standardized logging, timing, and error handling

    This proxy belongs to Tiozin's runtime layer and is not an orchestration mechanism.
    It does not schedule jobs, manage dependencies between jobs, or perform distributed
    orchestration. Its responsibility is to provide a consistent and safe execution
    environment for Job Tiozin plugins.
